				If you are a lab manager, or want to set up reimager to run in a new lab, you have to make sure to set the
				correct <span class="bold">Pixel Constant</span>. The pixel constant determines how the physical machine zooms,
				the scaling, and several other important features to properly provide accurate and precise values on the images.

					p.
						The pixel constant can be found under <span class='code'>help -> settings</span> or by clicking the bell on the
						navbar/header.
					p.
						It is important to get right and needs to be corrected with every physical modification to the
						machine so know when your data was taken and when the pixel constant might have changed (and
						if that change matters sufficiently).
					p Thankfully it's an easy process:
					p.
						The pixel constant is found by taking an image at various magnifications but all at 1024 resolution and
						dividing the number of microns by resolution.
					p.
						4000 mag at 1024 res image -> 29.883 microns across the entire image (left side to right side) ->
						29.883/1024 = 0.029183 Î¼m/pixel
					p.
						This process, when trended using Excel, will provide a formula like 116.73x^-1 or very close to x^-1. Put
						the constant (116.73) into the provided settings box and forget about it till next time you calibrate the
						probe.
				div
					p For example this is the exact data used to calibrate for the University of Minnesota Probelab's Microprobe:

				Some browsers and Windows 10 SmartScreen currently do not recognize Probelab ReImager due to it being new
				and unsigned code. Because of this, some systems will make sure you want to install the software.

							p.
								Windows SmartScreen can look scary, but pops up for a lot of new, unsigned programs. The process to
								allow a program to run anyway is very easy as shown by the images to the right.
							p.
								When the dialog pops up, by clicking on <span class='code'>More info</span> near the top of the window
								it will provide another button next to <span class='code'>Don't run</span> called
								<span class='code'>Run anyway</span>.
							p.
								This will allow for the installer to run and will not show up on future runs of the program. It's a one
								time problem.

								Mozilla Firefox will ask you if you are sure you want to run it, by clicking
								<span class='code'>OK</span> it will run the installer as normal.

								Please note this is not saying it <span class="bold">does contain</span> but rather that it
								<span class='bold'>could contain</span> malicious code since it is not a widely used software.

							p.
								When downloaded it will ask if you would like to delete or keep it, by clicking on the
								<span class='code'>. . .</span> and selecting <span class='code'>Keep</span>
							p.
								Doing this will bring you to the Downloads page where it will display
								a similar screen to <a href='#install-problems-win10'>Windows SmartScreen</a>. By clicking
								<span class='code'>Show more -> Keep anyway</span> it will allow you to run the installer.
