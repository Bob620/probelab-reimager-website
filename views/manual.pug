        If you are a lab manager, or want to set up reimager to run in a new lab, you have to make sure to set the correct
        <span class="bold">Pixel Constant</span>. The pixel constant determines how the physical machine zooms, the
        scaling, and several other important features to properly provide accurate and precise values on the images.
    div
      +anchor('h3', 'Pixel Constant', 'pixel-constant')
      p The pixel constant can be found under `help -> settings` or by clicking the bell on the navbar/header.

            It is important to get right and needs to be corrected with every physical modification to the
            machine so know when your data was taken and when the pixel constant might have changed (and
            if that change matters sufficiently).
          p Thankfully it's an easy process:
          p.
            The pixel constant is found by taking an image at various magnifications but all at 1024 resolution and dividing
            the number of microns by resolution.
          p 4000 mag at 1024 res image -> 29.883 microns across the entire image (left side to right side) -> 29.883/1024 = 0.029183 Î¼m/pixel
          p.
            This process, when trended using Excel, will provide a formula like 116.73x^-1 or very close to x^-1. Put the
            constant (116.73) into the provided settings box and forget about it till next time you calibrate the probe.

          p For example this is the exact data used to calibrate for the University of Minnesota Probelab's Microprobe:
